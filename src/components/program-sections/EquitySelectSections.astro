        <li>» Families who need flexible access to cash for home improvements, medical costs, or debt payoff</li>

      <p class="text-xs text-muted-foreground italic mt-1">
        Making the minimum payment does not cover the entirety of your interest charges, and additional interest will be added to the balance of your loan, resulting in a balloon payment that will be due at the end of the loan term.
